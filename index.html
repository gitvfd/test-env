<span style="color:#208320">Renewable energy finance and investment in India</span> 
<br><br>
Energy policy in India over the past decade has focused on creating enabling conditions to deliver renewable energy technologies onto market and to bring down their costs. 
<br><br>
The result has been a spectacular drop in prices for renewable energy solutions like solar photovoltaic (PV) and on-shore wind, where the cost of renewables in India is now less expensive than new coal-fired power and even much of existing coal-fired generation (<a href= "https://www.teriin.org/report/accelerating-indias-transition-renewables-key-messages-and-results-etc-india-project">TERI, 2019</a>). 
</a></p>

<p><a href="#story/796914/slide-2">
<span style="color:#FFD700">Current state of progress</span> 
<br><br>
 India has seen impressive growth in renewable electricity additions over the last decade, with more than 90 gigawatts (GW) of grid-connected renewable electricity capacity (excluding large hydro) installed by the end of 2020 (<a href="https://www.investindia.gov.in/sector/renewable-energy">Invest India, 2020</a>).
<br><br>
When accounting for large hydro (around 46 GW), <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1567817">recently considered as renewable</a> by the Government, total installed renewable energy sources in India account for over 36% of generation capacity (<a href="https://powermin.nic.in/en/content/power-sector-glance-all-india">Ministry of Power, 2021</a>).
</a></p>

<p><a href="#story/796914/slide-3">
<span style="color:#FFD700">Renewable energy ambitions</span> 
<br><br>
The Government of India has set ambitious targets of 227 GW of renewable power capacity by 2022 and 275 GW by 2027 (<a href="https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/india-will-have-227-gigawatt-of-renewable-energy-capacity-by-2022-vice-president/68887932">ET Energy, 2019</a>).
<br><br>
In 2019, Prime Minister Modi announced further ambitions to achieve 450 GW by 2030 (<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/pm-modi-vows-more-double-india-non-fossil-fuel-target-450-gw-1602422-2019-09-24">India Today, 2019</a>).
<br><br>
Achieving these ambitions requires steep growth in capacity additions – as well as the underlying investment – over the coming decade and beyond (<a href="https://www.ceew.in/publications/growing-clean-energy-markets-india-green-windows">NRDC-CEEW-IREDA, 2020</a>).
</a></p>

<p><a href="#story/796914/slide-4">
<span style="color:#FFD700">Implications for investment</span> 
<br><br>
As much as USD 300 billion, or about USD 30-33 billion per year, is needed over the coming decade to finance India’s 2030 targets (<a href="https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/budget2019-20/economicsurvey/index.php">Government of India, 2019</a>; <a href=" https://www.ceew.in/sites/default/files/CEEW-Financing-India-Energy-Transition-A-Guide-on-Greenbonds-17Jun19.pdf">CEEW, 2019</a>).
<br><br>
By comparison, renewable energy investment over the last five years was around USD 6-10 billion per annum on average (<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/catalytic-finance-underserved-clean-energy-markets-india-report-201810.pdf">NRDC-CEEW-IREDA, 2018</a>).
<br><br>
Scaling up this investment level is feasible, but it will require new channels beyond domestic financiers, who provide the bulk of renewable energy finance today and who realistically cannot double or triple their current lending levels to those projects.
</a></p>

<p><a href="#story/796914/slide-5">
<span style="color:#FFD700">Renewable energy finance today</span> 
<br><br>
Renewable energy financing in India is provided primarily through term loans by domestic financial institutions (<a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/files/reports/securitisation-as-an-enabler-of-green-asset-finance-in-india-report-15052020.pdf">CBI, 2019</a>).
<br><br>
Their lending capacity for long-lived assets like renewables is limited, due to power sector credit exposure ceilings (generally <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=5129">15-20%</a>) and bank liability profiles (<a href="https://webstore.iea.org/clean-energy-investment-trends-2019#:~:text=The%202019%20Clean%20Energy%20Investment,developments%20impacting%20the%20pace%20of">IEA-CEEW, 2019</a>).
<br><br>
In late 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) doubled the loan limit to Rs 30 crore (about USD 4 million) for individual renewable energy projects as priority sector lending.
<br><br>
However, this may still not address limits with large-scale renewable lending (<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/doubling-priority-lending-for-renewables-to-help-only-small-installations-120090600370_1.html">Business Standard, 2020</a>).
<br><br>
Microfinance institutions (MFIs), such as <a href="https://www.bfil.co.in/v1/">BFIL</a> and <a href="https://sewabharat.org/program-themes/solar-and-renewable-energy/">SEWA</a>, and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) such <a href="https://www.pfcindia.com/">PFC</a>, <a href="https://www.recindia.nic.in/">REC</a>, <a href="https://iifclmf.com/">IIFCL</a> and <a href="https://www.ireda.in/">IREDA</a> are similarly constrained by credit exposure limits (<a href="https://webstore.iea.org/clean-energy-investment-trends-2019#:~:text=The%202019%20Clean%20Energy%20Investment,developments%20impacting%20the%20pace%20of">IEA-CEEW, 2019</a>).
</a></p>

<p><a href="#story/796914/slide-6">
<span style="color:#FFD700">Challenges to growing renewable energy finance</span> 
<br><br>
Beyond exposure limits, it can be challenging for domestic financiers to provide long-term, fixed price loans (e.g. for 15 to 18 years), as their primary source of capital is short-term deposits (i.e. 3-5 years) (<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/catalytic-finance-underserved-clean-energy-markets-india-report-201810.pdf">NRDC-CEEW-IREDA, 2018</a>).
<br><br>
Scaling up finance for smaller transaction sizes (e.g. for solar irrigation pumps and rooftop PV) can also be a challenge, given the lack of a standardised framework to assess the creditworthiness of those smaller borrowers (<a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/files/reports/securitisation-as-an-enabler-of-green-asset-finance-in-india-report-15052020.pdf">CBI, 2019</a>).
</a></p>

<p><a href="#story/796914/slide-7">
<span style="color:#FFD700">Need for more attractive terms</span> 
<br><br>
The disaggregated nature of the renewables market adds to the cost of debt. 
<br><br>
The high cost of finance in India, including high variable interest rates and the mismatch between longer tenor of renewable energy projects and the shorter term debt market, can add between 30% and as much as 50% to the cost of renewable energy tariffs (<a href="http://resource-solutions.org/images/events/rem/presentations/2016/Shrimali.pdf">CPI, 2019</a>; <a href="https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/566266/adbi-wp1078.pdf">ADB, 2020</a>). 
<br><br>
High cost of finance equally affects private sector spending on renewable energy. For instance, Indian corporates looking to issue bonds typically pay high coupons, as rates of the basic government security are equally high (<a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/files/reports/securitisation-as-an-enabler-of-green-asset-finance-in-india-report-15052020.pdf">CBI, 2019</a>).
</a></p>

<p><a href="#story/796914/slide-8">
<span style="color:#FFD700">Efforts to improve renewable energy finance and investment</span> 
<br><br>

India has a number of initiatives and support mechanisms aimed at improving renewable energy finance and investment. 
<br><br>
These include (but are not limited to):
</a></p>

<p><a href="#story/796914/slide-9">
<span style="color:#FFD700">Catalysing renewable energy finance and investment</span> 
<br><br>
Global experience (e.g. in solar PV and on-shore wind) has shown that targeted public interventions can support increased flows of finance to renewable energy projects (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340648397_The_Role_of_Public_Banks_in_Catalyzing_Private_Renewable_Energy_Finance">Steffen, Egli & Schmidt, 2020</a>).
<br><br>
For example, risk mitigation (e.g. the <a href="https://www.ireda.in/doc/financing-norms/annexure-II.pdf">IREDA credit enhancement scheme</a>) and financial tools such as the <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_LAF_Search.aspx">RBI liquidity adjustment facility</a> help to enable flows of private capital to renewable energy projects.
<br><br>
A number of potential financing vehicles can build upon these initiatives, helping to catalyse the scale needed to finance India’s 2030 ambitions.

<span style="color:#FFD700">Opportunities moving forward</span>
<br><br>
<span style="color:grey">One such example is structured finance (e.g. via aggregation partnerships) to increase investment volumes and reduce due diligence costs.
<br><br>
Standardisation (e.g. of project documents) can also be used to prepare projects to be pooled as securitised assets for trading in capital markets (<a href="https://www.irena.org/publications/2016/Jun/Unlocking-Renewable-Energy-Investment-The-role-of-risk-mitigation-and-structured-finance">IRENA, 2016</a>).
<br><br>
Other financial instruments such as green bond issuance, which has <a href="https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/india-becomes-second-largest-market-for-green-bonds-with-10-3-billion-transactions/73898149">ramped up in India</a> in recent years, can help scale up and recycle capital for renewable energy projects. 
<br><br>
These instruments can also expand the current investor base, for instance tapping into international institutional investors such as insurance and pension funds (<a href="https://www.ceew.in/sites/default/files/CEEW-Financing-India-Energy-Transition-A-Guide-on-Greenbonds-17Jun19.pdf">CEEW-CBI, 2019</a>).

<br><br>
<br><br>
<span style="color: #FFD700">Lessons from global experience</span>
<br><br>
<span style="color:grey">The following case studies pull from experiences in developing and applying financing vehicles that have been used to increase overall finance and investment in renewable energy development. 
<br><br>
Common threads across these experiences include:
</span>
</p>	

<ul style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color:grey;">
<li><b>Identifying the right instrument:</b> each of the examples targeted a particular barrier (e.g. access to finance) or need (e.g. increased capital capacity) to design tailored solutions that addressed underlying risks and paved the way for increased flows of capital.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Engaging the right partner(s):</b> the interventions identified key partners (e.g. local financial institutions, credit specialists, business angels and industry experts) to help structure and prepare the financing mechanisms and ensure their effective application.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Targeting potential investors:</b> each case worked to address perceived risks and to demonstrate financial viability, helping to open the doors for potential investors, from venture capital and commercial banks to pension funds and company shareholders.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color:grey">
These shared considerations can be used to identify eventual opportunities and similar design elements that could be applied in the Indian context to increase finance and catalyse private investment in renewables.
