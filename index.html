<p><a href="#story/798859/slide-1">
Energy policy in India over the past decade has focused on creating enabling conditions to deliver renewable energy technologies onto market and to bring down their costs. </a></p>

<p><a href="#story/798859/slide-1">
The result has been a spectacular drop in prices for renewable energy solutions like solar photovoltaic (PV) and on-shore wind, where the cost of renewables in India is now less expensive than new coal-fired power and even much of existing coal-fired generation (<a href= "https://www.teriin.org/report/accelerating-indias-transition-renewables-key-messages-and-results-etc-india-project">TERI, 2019</a>). </a></p>

<p><a href="#story/798859/slide-2">India has seen impressive growth in renewable electricity additions over the last decade, with more than 90 gigawatts (GW) of grid-connected renewable electricity capacity (excluding large hydro) installed by the end of 2020 (<a href="https://www.investindia.gov.in/sector/renewable-energy">Invest India, 2020</a>).</a></p>

<p><a href="#story/798859/slide-2">When accounting for large hydro (around 46 GW), <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1567817">recently considered as renewable</a> by the Government, total installed renewable energy sources in India account for over 36% of generation capacity (<a href="https://powermin.nic.in/en/content/power-sector-glance-all-india">MoP, 2021</a>).<a></p>

<p><a href="#story/798859/slide-3">The Government of India has set ambitious targets of 227 GW of renewable power capacity by 2022 and 275 GW by 2027 (<a href="https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/india-will-have-227-gigawatt-of-renewable-energy-capacity-by-2022-vice-president/68887932">ET Energy, 2019</a>).

In 2019, Prime Minister Modi announced further ambitions to achieve 450 GW by 2030 (<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/pm-modi-vows-more-double-india-non-fossil-fuel-target-450-gw-1602422-2019-09-24">India Today, 2019</a>).

<p><a href="#story/798859/slide-3">Achieving these ambitions requires steep growth in capacity additions – as well as the underlying investment – over the coming decade and beyond (<a href="https://www.ceew.in/publications/growing-clean-energy-markets-india-green-windows">NRDC-CEEW-IREDA, 2020</a>).
